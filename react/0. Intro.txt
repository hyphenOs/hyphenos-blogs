React, a Facebook creation, which is a great framework for building Fast, Single Page User Interfaces and Web Apps,
also turned out a great journey for me. my journey of React (the better half of 2019) was a great
experience overall, considering the patterns I learnt by the grace of the mistakes I made.
it made me a better developer, abled me to "Think React"ively, enabling me to create or identify a pattern while coding.
these patterns, though learnt through React, are actually, "Software Patterns", and can be applied at a wider scope,
irrespective of the stack. I call these patterns my "DRY Principles". I'm using them frequently, resulting in increased
productivity.they are well structured and have frequent use-cases.
I'm very glad to share the valuables of my "React" journey with you. we will begin our journey with the "CRUD" Pattern

CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) is a very frequent use case or probably the most frequent use case in Development.
we will illustrate its functioning by creating a "Library" App that will have an Overview(Dashboard), list view
and a details view. let's see the CRUD Component structure.

1. Dashboard (overview):
    - an overview of the entire app (in our case, Books and Members count)
    - it will be the home page of the library app that will show the total numbers of books and members.

2. Book:
    - Fields: title, author, ISBN and year
    - every book will have above fields on both list and details view.
    - Create(C) and Update(U) part of CRUD will be implemented in details view using form
    - Read, Update and Delete (RUD) part of CRUD will be implemented in list view using:
        i. table for read (R) part
        ii. edit button for Update(U) part.
        iii. delete button for Delete(D) part
    - Update will be implemented in both list and details view

    now, we will check list and details views in Details

    a. Book List View :
        - it shows all the records in table format. implements Read and triggers Update and Delete (RUD).
    b. Book Details View:
        - it will be a form to input, validate and submit mentioned Book fields.
        - the same form will be used to validate, edit and submit existing record

that's all for this blog. we will see the entire implementation of CRUD Pattern including frontend code(React, Redux) and
backend code(Django Rest) in next blog. till then, Good Bye!
